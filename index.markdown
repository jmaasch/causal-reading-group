I am a PhD student in Computer Science and NSF Graduate Research Fellow at Cornell Tech. My research investigates machine learning and causal inference methods for computational biomedicine. I am particularly interested in developing methods for low-data regimes in clinical research and drug development using probabilistic, generative, and latent variable models. As a master's student researcher at Penn Engineering, I used machine learning to investigate the physicochemical properties and therapeutic potential of antimicrobial peptides.
